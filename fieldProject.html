My team and I had the privilege of working with an Oklahoma-based, multi-million-dollar corporation, tasked with elevating their data analytics team.<br>&emsp;Our primary objective was to enhance the maturity of their data analytics capabilities, and we achieved this by presenting recommendations for new platforms, tools, and staffing structures. A significant portion of our project was dedicated to bridging the communication gap between IT and management. To address this, we designed a custom integration visualization tool that eliminated the need for managers to wait for email responses, streamlining the process of obtaining information about the company's integrations. The tool, presented through a PowerPoint visualization, depicted a map of the company's integrations and their interconnections. Users could click on specific integrations to access detailed information instantly, revolutionizing daily operations and long-term strategic decision-making processes.<br>&emsp;In addition to the technical aspects, my team and I engaged in extensive discussions with executives, gathering their perspectives on key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics. Simultaneously, we analyzed the potential impact of emerging technologies on data analytics.</p></p>
